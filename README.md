House Price Predictor

Overview

This project is a machine learning-based solution for predicting house prices. It leverages historical housing data and applies various machine learning models to estimate the price of a house based on features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes.

Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model training and evaluation

Predicting house prices based on input features

Visualization of key insights and trends

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (optional for experimentation)

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Prepare your dataset and place it in the data/ directory.

Run the preprocessing script:

python preprocess.py

Train the model:

python train.py

Make predictions:

python predict.py --input sample_data.csv

Dataset

Ensure your dataset includes necessary features like:

House size (sq ft)

Number of bedrooms

Number of bathrooms

Location

Year built

Other relevant features

Model Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared score

Future Improvements

Integration of deep learning models

Deployment as a web application

Improved feature selection and hyperparameter tuning
