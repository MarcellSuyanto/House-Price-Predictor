# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based solution for predicting house prices. It leverages historical housing data and applies various machine learning models to estimate the price of a house based on features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Predicting house prices based on input features
- Visualization of key insights and trends

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for experimentation)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/house-prediction.git
   cd house-prediction
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. Make predictions:
   ```bash
   python house_prediction.py --input housing.csv
   ```

## Dataset
Ensure your dataset includes necessary features like:
- House size (sq ft)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Location
- Year built
- Other relevant features

## Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared score

## Future Improvements
- Integration of deep learning models
- Deployment as a web application
- Improved feature selection and hyperparameter tuning
